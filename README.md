Java program to calculate how many roses are being send to the next station based on what settings.

When sorting roses the machine will decide to which station the rose goes depending on certain criteria. Certain roses
are of higher quality and thus people pay more for them. This program runs besides the machine, reading the data through XML
and storing it in its database. It bascially shows the people what criteria are the reason roses get send to certain stations.

For example, why is this rose, which is tall enough (90cm) not being send to the right station, but to another one? Which results
in the rose being worth less money. Basically it just help them tweak the settings to get maximum value out of it.

Code was written somewhere around 2016, I think.
